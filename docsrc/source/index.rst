Welcome to PixieDust
================================

`PixieDust <https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/pixiedust>`_ is an open source Python helper library that works as an add-on to Jupyter notebooks to improve the user experience of working with data. It also fills a gap for users who have no access to configuration files when a notebook is hosted on the cloud. For more details on all that PixieDust offers to users and developers, see PixieDust's `README on GitHub <https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/pixiedust/blob/master/README.md>`_.
