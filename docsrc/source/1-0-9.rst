1.0.9
=====

Here's what's new in Release 1.0.7 (4 August 2017): 

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed an error triggered by running a display command on a DataFrame shared from a Scala notebook. PixieDust's "scala magic" feature allows users to share variables between Python and Scala Notebooks. Now, such shared Scala DataFrames are correctly displayed from within a Python context (`#425 <https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/issues/425>`_).

- PixieApp chart options are now accepted as JSON. Instead of adapting parameters into HTML-style tag attributes, PixieApp users can now simply paste valid JSON as the element content of the ``<pd_options>`` tag (`#423 <https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/issues/423>`_).
