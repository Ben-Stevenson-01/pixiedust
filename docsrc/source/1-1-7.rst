1.1.7
=====

Here's what's new in Release 1.1.7 (7 February 2018):           

**Bug fixes**

- Geospatial visualizations using the Mapbox renderer now allow for arbitrary values to be placed on maps. Previously, the UI would restrict values to numeric types only (`#460 <https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/issues/460>`_).

- Mapbox charts now correctly support popup boxes when hovering over a map symbol. The previous implementation only supported popups for numeric data types. Now, non-numeric data types are also supported in these messages (`#203 <https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/issues/203>`_).

- Mapbox visualizations now properly support feature data containing quote characters. PixieDust uses a new method for loading attributes into the map's iframe, preventing data containing quotes from breaking the process and displaying a blank canvas (`#461 <https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/issues/461>`_).

**Enhancements**

- Charts now support aggregate value filtering. Users can now define a filter while exploring a visualization generated by PixieDust's ``display()`` function. The old workflow forced users to shape the data by manipulating a DataFrame, and then relaunch the visualization (`#127 <https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/issues/127>`_).

- Charts using the Brunel renderer now properly display the legend, and line charts with multiple charts are now clearly labelled with different colors (`#519 <https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/issues/519>`_).

- Updated icons for selecting chart types (`#568 <https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/issues/568>`_).
