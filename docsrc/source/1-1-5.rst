1.1.5
=====

Here's what's new in Release 1.1.5 (5 January 2018):           

**Known issues**

- The minimum requirement for Bokeh is 0.12.9. Older versions will experience interactivity problems with charts rendered using Bokeh in PixieDust--most notably lack of zoom controls.

**Bug fixes**

- PixieDust now properly supports Python's string format operator: ``%`` (percent symbol). Previously when publishing PixieApps, Python statements using ``%`` to format strings were not properly resolved (`#510 <https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/issues/510>`_).

**Enhancements**

- PixieApps can now render Markdown syntax using the ``@captureOutput`` decorator (introduced in `release 1.1.4 <1-1-4.html>`_). When defining PixieApp views, users can choose between HTML or Markdown syntax in order to build apps as quickly and as easily as possible (`#542 <https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/pull/542>`_). Example usage for PixieApp Markdown rendering:

::


  from pixiedust.display.app import *
  from IPython.display import display_markdown
  
  @PixieApp
  class TestMarkdown():
      @route()
      @captureOutput
      def main_screen(self):
              display_markdown("""
  # Section Header
  ## Second *bullet*
  1. item1
  2. item2
  3. item3            
              """, raw=True)        
  TestMarkdown().run()
