===================

**The Publication Process**

Once you have developed your PixieApp in a Jupyter Notebook, here's how you can publish it to the web

Click on the **publish icon** (the electric plug icon ðŸ”Œ in the upper-right corner) to deploy the PixieApp into the PixieGateway.

The Publish Configuration dialog contains the following panels:

1. Basic configuration info, such as server address, page title, and page icon. The only required field is the PixieGateway server location. You can simply enter it, and click the **Publish** button.
