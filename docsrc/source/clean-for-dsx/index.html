     PixieDust
    </a>
    is an open source Python helper library that works as an add-on to Jupyter notebooks to improve the user experience of working with data. It also fills a gap for users who have no access to configuration files when a notebook is hosted on the cloud.

    </h2>
    <p>

     Create your own visualizations or apps using the pixiedust extensibility APIs. If you know HTML and CSS, you can write and deliver amazing graphics and make them available to notebook users.
