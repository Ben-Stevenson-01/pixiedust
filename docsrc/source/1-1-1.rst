1.1.1
=====

Here's what's new in Release 1.1.1 (20 October 2017):       

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a bug with apostrophe characters. PixieApps can now publish to the web with aposthrophes in the the page's title. Previously, using an apostrophe within the page title field of a PixieApp's Publish Configuration dialog (`example <https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3170980/31344598-1e0f6f8c-ace1-11e7-97c4-e30480ee87b6.png>`_) would cause the web publishing process to fail (`#464 <https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/issues/464>`_).

**Enhancements**

- An alpha release of **PixieDust chart sharing** is now live. PixieDust's ``display()`` function has long been a key feature of the library, allowing developers to automatically render charts from DataFrames. Now, PixieDust-rendered charts have been extended to automatically publish as web pages at the click of a button. `See the announcement blog <https://medium.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/share-your-jupyter-notebook-charts-on-the-web-43e190df4adb>`_ for more details (`#474 <https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/issues/474>`_).
