1.1.3
=====

Here's what's new in Release 1.1.3 (1 December 2017):            

**Enhancements**

- PixieDust now supports Brunel as an additional chart-rendering option for feature-rich interactive data visualizations (see: `http://brunel.mybluemix.net/docs/ <http://brunel.mybluemix.net/docs/>`_ for more details). The Brunel renderer for PixieDust supports all charts types: bar, line, scatter, pie, histogram, and maps. Maps, however, support extra visualization options: heatmap, treemap, and chords (`#326 <https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/issues/326>`_).
