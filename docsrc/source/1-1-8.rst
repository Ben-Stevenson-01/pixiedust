**Bug fixes**

**Enhancements**

- The 1.1.8 release introduces a visual Python debugger for Jupyter Notebooks: PixieDebugger. It is built as a `PixieApp <pixieapps.html>`_, and includes a source editor, local variable inspector, console output, the ability to evaluate Python expressions in the current context, breakpoints management, and a toolbar for controlling code execution. In addition to debugging traditional notebook cells, PixieDebugger also works to debug PixieApps, which is especially usefule when troubleshooting issues with routes. See this `blog post for usage examples <https://medium.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/the-visual-python-debugger-for-jupyter-notebooks-youve-always-wanted-761713babc62>`_. More documentation on PixieDebugger will be added to this site soon (`#623 <hhttps://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/issues/623/>`_).
