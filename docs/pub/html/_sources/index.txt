Welcome to PixieDust
================================

`PixieDust <https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/pixiedust>`_ is an open source Python helper library that works as an add-on to Jupyter notebooks to improve the user experience of working with data. It also fills a gap for users who have no access to configuration files when a notebook is hosted on the cloud. For more details on all that PixieDust offers to users and developers, see `PixieDust's README on GitHub <https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/pixiedust/blob/master/README.md>`_.

There are 2 ways to dive into PixieDust:

- **Use PixieDust in a Python notebook.**  Try a demo notebook. PixieDust is built-in to IBM's `Data Science Experience <http://datascience.ibm.com/>`_. For a quick look at PixieDust, you can sign up for a free trial there, and create a new notebook from URL using this sample: ``https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/pixiedust/raw/master/notebook/Intro%20to%20PixieDust.ipynb`` 

- **Develop for PixieDust**  Didn't find a what you need? Create your own visualizations or apps using the pixiedust extensibility APIs. If you know HTML and CSS, you can write and deliver amazing graphics without forcing notebook users to type one line of code. Use the shape of the data to control when Pixiedust shows your visualization in a menu.
